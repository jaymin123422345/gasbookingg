                    <h3> 5KG Gas Cylinder</h3>
                    <p>One of the main concerns people faced when getting a new gas connection is the long waiting period. The process of applying for a new connection is slow and tedious most of the times. So this very reason, many preferred to buy private gas connections even though it was expensive. To help customers get safe cooking gas in less time, Bharatgas introduced “Mini Connection”. A Bharatgas Mini connection is a 5 Kg LPG cylinder available with or without Domestic Pressure Regulator (DPR) which will be sold at various Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) retail outlets across the country. For now, Bharatgas Mini connection is sold at over 100 petrol stations in the country.

Bharatgas will be sold under the Free Trade LPG (FTL) scheme. When a customer buys Bharatgas MIni for the first time, cost of equipment (DPR plus cylinder), administrative charges, and cost of the product will be payable. When a customer books a refill, only the cost of the product will be charged. Bharatgas Mini focuses on making domestic cooking gas easily accessible
